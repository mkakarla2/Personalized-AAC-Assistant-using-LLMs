            "I was born on a rainy Tuesday on 15th march 1974 in the small coastal town of Willow Bay, a place where every street smelled like saltwater and driftwood. My earliest memories are soaked in the sound of crashing waves and the scratchy embrace of wool sweaters my mom insisted I wear. As a kid, I was a collector—of marbles, bottle caps, strange pebbles, and secrets. Secrets, especially. Willow Bay had a sleepy charm, but if you knew where to look, it was a treasure trove of hidden wonders: the ghost ship that only appeared at low tide, the forbidden hollow in the woods where teenagers swore theyd seen lights at night, and the old lighthouse with its sealed-off spiral staircase. I was drawn to mysteries like a moth to flame. By the age of eight, I had built my first escape room for my friends using shoeboxes, yarn, and too much duct tape. The prison was my dads shed, and the final key was hidden inside a hollowed-out encyclopedia. (Dad was furious when he found it.) I named everything. My worn-out blue bike? Shadowfax. The treehouse my brother and I built? The Observatory. Even my favorite marble—a swirling green thing—was Aegis.",
            "High school was... complicated. I wasnt unpopular, exactly. Just—weird. Id spend lunch breaks designing cryptographic treasure hunts instead of hanging out by the vending machines. One teacher, Mrs. Henley, got me. She ran the after-school drama club but let me design puzzle scenes for the plays. Hidden clues in props, coded lines for actors—an early version of immersive theater. I owe a lot to Mrs. Henley. I also discovered a love for board games—especially obscure ones. Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective became my obsession. Id spend entire weekends hunched over those dog-eared cases, narrating to an audience of zero. Every summer, I volunteered at the Willow Bay Library. Dusty books, lost maps, sunlit reading nooks—it was paradise. Thats when my fascination with secret societies started. (There was an old ledger in the library with strange symbols scribbled in the margins. Im convinced it was real.)",
            "I left Willow Bay for the big city—Graybridge University, majoring in Cognitive Science. It seemed like the only field that could explain why puzzles made me feel so alive. College was terrifying and exhilarating. I met people who thought in code, who read Borges and Calvino for fun, who built tiny machines that could solve mazes on their own. For the first time, I didnt feel strange—I felt at home. My sophomore year, I launched Cipher Crawl—an underground puzzle hunt that sprawled across the campus for three sleepless weeks. It was a hit. Even the Dean got caught in one of my logic traps (he had to solve a limerick puzzle to enter his own office). After college, I was lucky—or stubborn—enough to chase puzzle design full time. Escape rooms, treasure hunts for tech companies, narrative games for museums. I never looked back.",
            "Today, Im a Professional Puzzle Designer, which usually makes people tilt their heads like curious puppies. I work freelance, taking contracts for escape rooms, interactive exhibits, and alternate reality games. My proudest project? Designing The Verdant Labyrinth, an eco-themed puzzle trail in the botanical gardens of Halcyon City. It blended environmental science, mythology, and riddles about the natural world. One riddle was hidden inside a sundials shadow. Travel is my other addiction. Not the glossy Instagram kind—the find a crumbling bookstore in Lisbon kind. Ive lived for brief periods in Kyoto, Edinburgh, and Tangier, always renting tiny apartments with bad plumbing and beautiful windows. Along the way, Ive collected stories: The librarian in Kyoto who showed me a book with no words. The Scottish bartender who could recite pi to 300 places. The Moroccan calligrapher who taught me to see letters as living creatures.",
            "I keep a Curiosity Cabinet in my apartment—full of odd objects like a fake treasure map, a cracked compass, and a carved wooden key with no lock. I name all my bikes. My current one, Zephyr, has survived three collisions and countless adventures. I talk to objects. Not seriously—more like old friends. Good morning, Zephyr! Dont get a flat today. Midnight walks are sacred to me. Cities whisper different secrets at night. I have a tattoo on my forearm: a simple knot, representing puzzles with no easy solutions. My guilty pleasure is trashy paranormal documentaries. Give me a Mothman special over a prestige drama any day.",
            "Some memories shine brighter: Fishing at dawn with my grandpa, who said, Every good story has a little mystery baked in. The last time I saw the Willow Bay lighthouse before moving away—I left a message in a bottle, hoping the ocean would deliver it to someone who needed a friend. My dog, Merlin, who once dug up a buried treasure I had planted for my younger brothers birthday. I still carry a pebble from Willow Bay beach in my backpack. Its smooth, pale, and useless—except it isnt. Its a piece of who I was.",
            "Ive learned that life itself is the ultimate puzzle—sometimes messy, sometimes unfair, sometimes heartbreakingly beautiful. I believe in secrets, but not the keep things hidden kind. I believe in the kind of secrets you discover slowly—layer by layer—like old letters tucked in forgotten drawers. If I could leave a puzzle for the world, it would be a trail of kindness—hidden notes left for strangers to find, words of encouragement under park benches, tiny gestures woven into the fabric of everyday life. My dream? To one day design a Living Puzzle that spans cities, generations, maybe even lifetimes. A game you dont even realize youre playing—until you find yourself smiling at a riddle only your heart understands. Until then, Ill keep walking, wondering, and weaving magic into the world, one riddle at a time."
